A photo album of some of my best amateur photos!

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
To make this, I used an array that held my photos. I used a click function that would go through the pictures on by one. On every third click , a random picture would be pulled to the source of my image element. Additionally, I made a row of images. I made a click function for each image. When the image is clicked it is appended to the array by index number. 

Optimizations
(optional)
If I were to add more to this, I would make the row of images at the bottom have a left and right scroll through more than 15 photographs, so that I could showcase even more photos. 

Lessons Learned:
I learned about changing the source of images and using web development for fun purposes.
